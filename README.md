# Sample-Apache5-Application

Project Description:

This project implements a simple performance testing tool using Apache HttpClient v5.x to send repeated HTTP GET requests to a specified URL. The tool continuously makes requests at a fixed interval (every 5 seconds) and logs key information from each response, including the HTTP version, status code, and reason phrase.

The main objective of this project is to test the performance of HTTP communication and response handling in a controlled environment. It provides a basic framework for monitoring server performance and can be extended to test scalability, response times, and error handling under continuous load.

Key Features:

1.Utilizes Apache HttpClient v5.x for making HTTP GET requests.

2.Logs essential details from each response (HTTP version, status code, reason phrase).

3.Implements a loop to continuously send requests at regular intervals (5 seconds).

4.Proper error handling for network and parsing issues.

5.Designed for performance testing and profiling of web services or APIs.

6.This project can serve as a foundation for more advanced performance testing tools and can be easily modified to handle different HTTP methods or integrate with more sophisticated logging and monitoring frameworks.
